# Word Count
A simple utility working with files (for linux-based OS), a homework from last year.

-l, --lines   counts the number of lines in given file(s)

-c, --bytes   counts the byte size of given file(s)

-w, --words   counts the number of words in given file(s)

-m, --chars   counts the number of chars in given file(s)
